   <center><p> I have several experiences in the associative life, I have been a volunteer at the Tunisian Red Crescent since 2019. Thanks to this experience,<br> I have made numerous acquaintances and have been able to integrate myself into various aspects of associative life.<br> However, the most important aspect for me is the opportunity to help people and set a good example for others.</p></center>

    <center><p>I am also a member of the Mechatronics Club at ENICarthage, which is primarily focused on robotics.<br> Building and working on robots has been a challenging and rewarding experience for me, as each robot presents a unique set of challenges </p></center>
    <center><p> Here's an exemplary video of a robotics competition. Let's enjoy watching it together</p></center>
